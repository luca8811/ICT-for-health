## ðŸ“š Laboratory Overview

This repository contains the lab assignments developed for the *ICT for Health* course (Politecnico di Torino, A.Y. 2023/24). Each lab tackles a different real-world biomedical data analysis problem using Python, machine learning and signal processing techniques.

### ðŸ”¬ Labs Description

- **Lab 1 â€“ Regression on Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Data**
  Linear regression is used to estimate the total UPDRS score (a measure of disease severity) from patientsâ€™ voice features.

- **Lab 2 â€“ Gaussian Process Regression**
  Application of non-parametric Gaussian process regression to the Parkinsonâ€™s dataset, using kernel functions and model validation.

- **Lab 3 â€“ ROC Curve Analysis for COVID-19**
  Evaluation of COVID-19 serological tests by computing sensitivity, specificity, and selecting optimal thresholds using ROC curves.

- **Lab 4 â€“ Human Activity Recognition**
  Activity classification using time-series sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer). Clustering (K-means) is used to identify 19 physical activities.

- **Lab 5 â€“ Chronic Kidney Disease Detection**
  Data cleaning and preprocessing of a medical dataset with missing values, followed by classification using a decision tree.

- **Lab 6 â€“ ICA and EEG Analysis**
  Signal separation using FastICA on synthetic data and EEG data analysis using EEGLAB in MATLAB, with preprocessing and ICA for artifact removal.
